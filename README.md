# Hexo Theme Cake

:fish_cake: It's a lovely theme, based on [NexT](https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next).

## Todo List
- [x] Add new filter `theme_inject`. For custom head header and sidebar (comment post_mate in future);
- [x] Refactor commment.
- [x] Replace include to partial.
- [x] Remove exturl. There are not any benefit with BASE64 encrypt & decrypt.
- [ ] Refactor fonts.
- [ ] Refactor post_mate.
- [ ] Remove Muse Mist Pisces.
